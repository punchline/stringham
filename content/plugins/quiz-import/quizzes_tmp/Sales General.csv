An investment property had a rate of return of 9.5%, and the NOI was $38,560. What was the value of the property?,$405,895,$367,225,$386,500,$428,506,Divide the NOI (LAST) by the 9.5% (RATE) to get the Value (FIRST).  Think of it as "Falue."
The Z family purchased their first home for $160,500. They got an 85% loan and paid two discount points. They had additional closing costs of $3,250. How much cash did they have to bring to settlement?,$30,053.50,$28,617.00,$25,450.25,$25,000.10,The loan is a percent, and so are the discount points, so two FRL's will be needed.  #1:  Purchase price x 85% to get the loan amount. #2: loan amount x 2% to get the points.  Step 3: subtract the loan from the purchase price for the down payment. Then just add to the down payment the points and the $3,250 in closing costs and you have your answer!
The commission split is 70/30, and the brokerage charges sellers 6%. The agent took home $8,500 last month for one sale. What was the selling price?,$202,381,$195,682,$198,434,$201,999,This is a two FRL question because it deals with two percents.  We start with the agent's portion as that's what we're given.  LAST is the agent's $8,500.  FIRST is the gross commission, our "I don't know."  RATE is 70% (remember the agent's split is the first number).  Divide the one below the line by the one above, or $8,500 by 70% to get the gross commission.  Then, same idea for the 2nd FRL.  LAST is the gross commission which you just computed.  FIRST is the selling price which we don't know.  RATE equals what is in L, and the rate that equals the gross commission is 6%.  Again, divide this one below the line by the one above for the answer.
The commission structure for the brokerage was 5% on the first $1,000,000 and 8% on the rest. The property sold for $1,345,000. How much was the commission?,$77,600,$67,250,$97,250,$174,850,One million x 5% = part of the commission - $50,000.  "The rest," or $345,000 x 8% = $27,600.  Add the two parts together for the correct answer.
Broker L listed a home that sold for the full price of $325,000. The contract called for a 6.5% commission. How much did Broker L make?,$21,125,$18,500,$20,250,$23,500,These are simple:  sales price multiplied by the commission percent for the commission dollars.  Or, commission dollars divided by the sales price for the commission %.
The buyers insisted they were not interested in a property that was less than 1.75 acres in size. A house on a property that was 465 feet by 643 feet looked great. How many acres does it have?,6.86,4.5,5.75,7.25,Length times width gives area:  465' x 643' = 298,995 sq. feet.  Divide by 43,560 (the number of feet in an acre).
M's back yard measured 56 feet deep by 82 feet wide. M is going to buy grass seed to plant a lawn. The package indicates how much is needed based on square yards. How many square yards are in M's back yard?,510,170,765,4,592,Length times width gives area:  56 x 82 = 4,592 square feet.  But, we need the answer in square yards. Since there are 9 square feet in a square yard, divide the 4,592 by 9.
The R's bought a home and obtained a loan for $128,000 at 7.25% interest per year, 30 year term. Their monthly P/I payment is $873.19. What is the total amount of interest they will pay over the full term of the loan?,$186,348.40,$314,348.00,$196,500.38,$278,400.00,This one is so easy!  P/I pmt. Of $873.19 times 360 payments = total payoff.  Subtract the original loan and the rest is the interest.
If the interest rate on a straight loan is 8% and the monthly interest payment is $650, what is the amount of the loan?,$97,500,$103,250,$88,750,$75,682,FIRST = loan; RATE = interest rate; LAST = annualized interest dollars.  Annualize the $650 and "divide the one below the line by the one above."
K wanted a property that was at least 3/4 of an acre in size. K liked the home on a property 434' by 289'. How many acres is this particular parcel?,2.88 acres,3 acres,1.76 acres,2.33 acres,Length x width will give you the area in square feet.  Divide that by the number of square feet in an acre (43,560) to determine the amount of area expressed as acreage.
The appraiser was determing the value of the property based on the cost approach. The outside dimensions of the home were 28' x 40' and the cost was $11.25 per square foot. His estimate of value was:,$12,600.00,$765.00,$1,530.00,$126,000.00,o get the number of square feet, multiply length times width.  Then merely multiply the total square feet by the cost per square foot.
The home to be insured had a value of $313,500. It was only insured for 85% of its value, and the cost for insurance was .65 per $100 of value for a three-year policy. How much was the premium for one year?,$577.36,$533.42,$625.00,$638.50,This problem has several steps:  1) Value x 85% to determine the value for insurance. 2) Divide that number by 100 (how many units of $100?)  3) Multiply that by .65 to get the cost of a three year policy. 4) Divide by 3 to get one year's premium.
Phil paid $2,500 in discount fees on his new loan. If the discount fees were 1.50% and Phil received a 90% LTV loan, what was the appraised value of the property?,$185,185.17,$186,186.17,$150,000.00,$149,999.99,Always have to go "bottom up" on this. Start with the $2,500 that Phil has paid. Divide by the 1.5% which gets you $166,666.66. Taking that answer and dividing by 90% will equal the appraised value. Hint: Writing the math steps going forward, will assist you in working backwards on these types of problems.
The Q's purchased some raw land for $35,000, thinking it would be worth a lot more in a few years. They sold it five years later for $42,000. What was their profit?,20%,15%,25%,35%,FIRST = bought; LAST = sold; RATE = selling price as a percent.  Remember question 6:  What rate equals L (thing that happened last?)  Bought for $35,000.  Sold for $42,000.  Divide the one below the line by the one above and you get 120%.  That is NOT 120% profit.  100% is getting back their investment, so 20% is the profit.
A lot was purchased as an investment for $10,500. It was sold a year later at a loss of 20%. What was the loss on the sale?,$2,100,$3,150,$8,400,$1,260,FIRST = purchase price; RATE = loss; LAST = loss in dollars.  Since you kow the two numbers above the line, multiply down for the answer.

It is the right to do something different and be legal about it. The business answer will be a legal non-conforming use as the use was their first.  The area between two types of zoning would be a buffer.
The purpose of a document receipt is to verify that:,all parties have received fully signed copies of the Real Estate Purchase Contract.,all involved agents and brokers have signed the purchase agreement.,both the buyer and seller received all appropriate documents at the closing.,the buyer signed all documents involved with the loan.,A document receipt is just what it says:  a receipt for documents.

If a property was worth $233,087 two years ago and it appreciated at the rate of 6% each year, how much is it worth now?,$261,897,$259,633,$261,057,$263,942,Don't say:  two years at 6% = 12%, so $233,087 x 12%.  It appreciated 6% each year (in other words, it compounded).  So original value x 6% and add the two (or multiply by 106% for one step).  That gives you the value after one year.  Take that new value and do it again.
A property had a net operating income of $3,430. If the property had a value of $22,000, what was the rate of return of this property?,15.59%,1.56%,0.16%,6.41%,This is a cap rate, capitalization, or rate of return question.  FIRST = Value (Falue); RATE = rate of return; LAST = NOI (remember it must be an annual number).  We have the value at the top, the NOI at the bottom, so we divide the one below the line by the one above the line.
A home listed with ABC Realty sold for $168,500. If the closing costs were $3,825 and the commission was $11,795, what was the rate of commission?,7%,6.80%,7.16%,7.25%,Commission problems have three elements:  Selling price, % commission and $ commission.  If you have any two, you can compute the third.  For FRL:  FIRST=Selling price; RATE=% commission; LAST=$ commission.  Divide the $ of commission ($11,795) by the Selling price ($168,500) to get the answer. (Divide the one below the line by the one above.)
The commission structure for the brokerage was 5% on the first $1,000,000 and 8% on the rest. The property sold for $1,345,000. How much was the commission?,$77,600,$67,250,$97,250,$174,850,One million x 5% = part of the commission - $50,000.  "The rest," or $345,000 x 8% = $27,600.  Add the two parts together for the correct answer.
The loan on the property was for 85% of its appraised value. The interest on the loan was 9%. The interest in the first payment was $1,205 . What was the appraised value of the property?,$189,020,$195,383,$200,555,$215,769,Whoa, this one throws a lot at you!  Start at the end:  we want the appraised value, but the loan was only 85% of that.  So first we have to arrive at the loan.  Remember:  Loan is FIRST, the interest % is RATE, and the interest dollars are LAST (and must be annualized to match the rate).  So, $1,205 x 12 = $14,460 annualized interest.  Divide the one below the line by the one above (interest rate) and get $160,666.67 for the loan.  Now 2nd FRL, appraised value came FIRST, 85% is the RATE, and the loan is LAST.  "Divide the one below the line by the one above the line" or the loan by 85% to get the appraised value.
Sam obtained an interest only loan on the property for 65% of its appraised value. The interest rate was 12.5%. The first semi-annual interest payment was $6,000. What was the appraised value?,$147,692.31,$62,400.00,$77,384.62,$126,001.10,Whoa, this one throws a lot at you!  Start at the end:  we want the appraised value, but the loan was only 65% of that.  So first we have to arrive at the loan.  Remember:  Loan is FIRST, the interest % is RATE, and the interest dollars are LAST (and must be annualized to match the rate).  So, $6,000 x 2 = $12,000 annualized interest.  Divide the one below the line by the one above (interest rate) and get $96,000 for the loan.  Now 2nd FRL, appraised value came FIRST, 65% is the RATE, and the loan is LAST.  "Divide the one below the line by the one above the line" or the loan by 65% to get the appraised value.
A single family investment property had a GRM of 92.68. The monthly gross rents were $1,800. What is the value of the property based on the GRM?,$166,824,$135,850,$148,500,$152,320,You need to remember the formula:  Selling price divided by gross rents = GRM.  In this case we are given the GRM and rents, so we will modify the basic formula to the gross rents multiplied by the GRM for the value.
A straight loan has monthly interest payments of $738.02. The interest rate is 7.67%. What is the amount of the principal?,$115,465.97,$118,934.89,$124,362.08,$130,698.98,All loan problems:  Loan is FIRST interest is RATE and interest payment is LAST.  Just remember, interest % is annual so you may have to adjust the interest dollars to be annual because R equals L.  So take the $738.02 monthly interest times 12 to annualize it.  Then "divide the one below the line by the one above the line" or $8,856.24 divided by 7.67% = the principal (original loan or current balance).
M obtained a loan for $80,000 at 9 1/2% interest for thirty years. The payment is $672.68 including principal and interest. How much interest would M pay over the full term of the loan?,$162,164.80,$242,266.01,$228,000.00,$308,000.00,This one is so easy!  P/I pmt. Of $672.68 times 360 payments = total payoff.  Subtract the original loan and the rest is the interest.
M's back yard measured 56 feet deep by 82 feet wide. M is going to buy grass seed to plant a lawn. The package indicates how much is needed based on square yards. How many square yards are in M's back yard?,510,170,765,4,592,Length times width gives area:  56 x 82 = 4,592 square feet.  But, we need the answer in square yards. Since there are 9 square feet in a square yard, divide the 4,592 by 9.
The buyers insisted they were not interested in a property that was less than 1.75 acres in size. A house on a property that was 465 feet by 643 looked great. How many acres does it have?,6.86,4.5,5.75,7.25,Length times width gives area:  465' x 643' = 298,995 sq. feet.  Divide by 43,560 (the number of feet in an acre).
A sporting goods store had a lease agreement to pay 1.75% on all income over $56,000 a month gross in addition to the base rent they paid of $2,000. Last year they paid $56,500 in rent. What was their total gross income?,$2,529,143,$1,368,321,$1,857,143,$1,954,330,This is a percentage rent problem.  Before doing the FRL, there's a preliminary step: Paid rent minus base rent.  So, $56,500 paid minus $24,000 base = $32,500 extra rent.  FIRST = extra income; RATE = 1.75%; LAST = extra rent ($32,500).  Divide the one below the line by the one above and you get the extra income.  Add that to the $56,000 base income to get gross income.
The owner wants to net $40,000 upon selling the property. The commission is 7%, there will be $2,500 in closing costs, plus a $450 fee to the attorney. What does the property need to sell for to get the owner $40,000 net?,$46,182.80,$50,125.00,$200,555,$215,716,Always have to go "bottom up" on this.  Work from the top down and you'll be close, but no cigar!  FIRST is the selling price, our "I don't know" so the question mark goes there.  LAST is the net.  But the seller doesn't only need the $40,000, but also enough to cover closing costs and the attorney.  So $42,950 is what he really needs to net.  For LAST, what % equals the "net?"  It sells for the magic 100%, 7% comes out for commission, so 93% equals the net.  Divide the one below the line by the one above, or $42,950 by 93% to get the answer.
Tom wants to clear $90,000 when he sells his property. He must pay a 7% commission, $250 in closing cost, and $300 to the attorney who assisted in the transaction.

FIRST is the selling price, our "I don't know" so the question mark goes there.  LAST is the net.  But the seller doesn't only need the $90,000, but also enough to cover closing costs and the attorney.  So $90,550 is what he really needs to net.  For LAST, what % equals the "net?"  It sells for the magic 100%, 7% comes out for commission, so 93% equals the net.  Divide the one below the line by the one above, or $90,550 by 93% to get the answer.

Which is true?,Both Broker L and Broker S are agents of the seller.,Broker L is the agent of the buyer.,Broker L is the subagent of the buyer.,Broker S is the agent for the buyer and seller.,It helps a lot with these types of questions to diagram the players on paper. Utah says a licensee must represent one or both of the parties in a real estate transaction.  Since it says S does not have a contract with the buyer, and it does say the listing was published across the MLS, both brokers represent the seller - L as agent, S as subagent.

If you're not familiar with them, it would be good to go back and review.
The Y Co. needed a large parcel of land to relocate their business. They found two parcels next to each other priced at $80,000 and $95,000 and purchased them both. Subsequently they found a better site and sold the two parcels to one buyer for $205,000. This illustrates the concept of:,Plottage,Neighborhood Cycle,Assemblage,Situs,The combined value of the two was $175,000.  If the single parcel had sold for that, it would have been assemblage.

Mrs. Brown has a contractual obligation to pay Ms. Larsen, her agent, a 6.5% brokerage fee for her services. Title costs are $1,300 and the seller is required to pay an extra $2,600 to cover carpet for the buyer. Assuming these are the only closing costs, what is the minimum selling price of the home if Mrs. Brown wants to net $150,000?,$164,598.93,$153,900.00,$164,327.80,$2,367,692.30,Yet another question where you must work backwards. The seller needs to net $150,000. To this we need to add our closing costs first. Sales agents are commissioned on the selling price of the home and not the price of the home plus the closing costs. That is why we add the closing costs first in this equation. At this point, if there was no agent commission owed, the minimum selling price would merely be the net required by the seller ($150,000) plus the closing costs ($3,900). Giving us a total of $153,900. The next step is more tricky... A common mistake is dividing by 6.5% using this calculation will get you a ridiculous number. The trick to this question is to remember that we are wanting what is net to the seller. In this case, we are going to take 100%, minus the 6.5% commission, for 93.5% which is left over for the seller. Now we can use the $153,900 divide this figure by 93.5% and you have the minimum selling price of the home.
Mrs. Hawkins has a contractual obligation to pay Mr. Cooper, her agent, a 5% brokerage fee for his services. The borrower has a loan of 80% LTV, and discount points of 2%.

Assuming these are the only closing costs for the buyer and seller, what is the minimum selling price of the home if Mrs. Hawkins wants to net $65,000?,$70,789.47,$72,157.89,$71,971.05,$70,671.05,This is another question where you must work backwards. The information regarding the buyer's closing costs is irrelevant. The seller needs to net $65,000. To this we need to add our closing costs first (again the buyer's discount fees are not subtracted from what the seller is to receive and are not included in the seller's closing costs). Sales agents are commissioned on the selling price of the home and not the price of the home plus the closing costs. That is why we add the closing costs first in this equation. At this point, if there was no agent commission owed, the minimum selling price would merely be the net required by the seller ($65,000) plus the closing costs ($2,250). Giving us a total of $67,250. The next step is more tricky... A common mistake is dividing by 5% using this calculation will get you a ridonculous number. The trick to this question is to remember that we are wanting what is net to the seller. In this case, we are going to take 100%, minus the 5% commission, for 95% which is left over for the seller. Now we can use the $67,250 divide this figure by 95% and you have the minimum selling price of the home.

A large benefit of using a credit report to process an application is:,It is factual record of history allowing a quick and objective decision.,It provides a seasoned and expert opinion on the applicant's character.,The applicant can never determine what the loan decision was based on.,It may be the only way to verify an applicant's assets.,(Application & Underwriting)  A credit report is a factual record of a consumer's payment history as reported by their creditors.  It is used to assist lenders with quick and objective credit granting decisions.
A credit score:,Represents the probability of a serious delinquency on an account over the next 24 months.,Is a numerical estimate of borrower's ability to honor past obligations.,Is a statistical average of willingness to pay future obligations.,Represents Mr. Isaac's mathematical genius in predicting loan losses.,(Foreclosure & Credit)  A credit score expresses the probability that a consumer will have a serious delinquency on an account (at least 90 days past due) over the next two years.
About 35% of the credit score consists of:,How promptly and consistently the applicant pays his/her obligations.,The applicant's mix of trade accounts open.,The applicant's most recent 6 months of payment behavior.,The applicant's attitude toward taking on new debt.,(Application & Underwriting)  Payment information for specific accounts reported in the credit report represents 35% of the credit score.
The key difference between a promissory note and a mortgage is:,Promissory notes are signed by people personally obligated to repay the loan.,A mortgage is signed by anyone obligated to repay the loan.,A promissory note can be assumed by a new property owner.,There are no personal guarantees on a promissory note.,(Mortgage Law)  The Promissory Note represents a personal promise by every one who signs the Note to repay the loan.  Every person who signs the Note individually promises to repay the entire amount regardless of how well the other signers meet their personal obligations.

All of the following are facts about flood insurance EXCEPT:,Properties in a flood zone identified by FEMA must carry flood insurance.,Homeowner's insurance does not cover loss from floods.,Flood insurance rates are fixed by the National Flood Insurance Program.,Floods can occur throughout the United States and are the number one natural hazard.,Homes with mortgages from federally regulated or insured lenders in high-risk flood areas designated with the letters "A" or "V" are required to have flood insurance.  Homeowner's insurance does not cover loss from floods - only flood insurance can.  Floods are the number one natural hazard, and they occur in all 50 states.  The federally-insured, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance which can be purchased through most leading insurance companies.  Rates are set and do not differ from company to company or agent to agent.
The best way to describe an appraisal is:,It is an independent, objective opinion of market value at the time of the appraisal.,It represents the highest and best price a buyer should pay.,It is a scientifically determined and universally accepted resale value for sellers.,It represents the minimum value in which a lender would fund a loan.,Appraisers provide an independent, educated and experienced estimate of a specific property's value at a particular point in time.  The buyer, and particularly the lender providing funds for the transaction depend on an objective, third party such as a licensed, state-certified appraiser to assign a market value to the property.
All of the following are true about residential appraisals EXCEPT:,The appraiser's final estimated market value readily allows for an increase in settlement costs up to 10% before the closing.,A lender will generally limit the loan to a maximum percentage of the appraised value of the property.,A successful closing can be highly dependent on the appraiser's opinion of value.,Since a borrower's available cash for closing is generally limited and the lending guidelines are rigid, the loan originator should carefully review the appraisal for any errors.,The loan application process and decision to lend money is heavily dependent on the appraisal report.  The majority of buyers face difficulty coming up with enough of their own cash at closing to complete the deal so they need every penny of the requested loan amount.  A lender has strict guidelines on how much to lend and it's generally based on a maximum percentage of the market value of the property.  Often, there is no margin for error; the full potential market value assumed in the loan application may be necessary to have a successful closing.
The sales comparison approach to property valuation:,Is based on the concept that a buyer is willing to pay only as much money as he/she would have to pay for another similar property.,Is viewed to be the least accurate because it is based on buyer/seller emotion.,Has nothing to do with the buyer or seller, it is determined statistically by the appraiser.,Is based on how much more a buyer would pay to upgrade from his/her present home.,The sales comparison approach is based on the principle of substitution which states that a buyer is willing to pay only as much money to purchase a property as they would have to pay for another similar property.  It reflects what we all do everyday when we comparison shop... whenever we have a choice  between two or more products that will serve our needs.
Using the sales comparison method, the property adjustment for a comparable property that is viewed to be worth $10,000 more because it is newer would be:,Subtract $10,000 from the comparable property.,Add $10,000 to the subject property.,Subtract $10,000 from the subject property.,Add $10,000 to the comparable property.,A characteristic such as less wear and tear makes the comparable better so the value of that factor is subtracted from the comparable.  Never adjust the price of a subject property.
Using the sales comparison method, if a subject property had an extra full bathroom ($6,000) that the comparable property did not, but was on a less desirable lot ($5,000), the proper adjustment would be:,Add $1,000 to the comparable property.,Add $1,000 to the subject property.,No adjustment necessary.,Add $11,000 to the comparable property.,A characteristic such as having an extra bathroom in the subject property is the same as saying the comparable is inferior so you would add $6,000 to the price of the comparable.  Since the subject's lot is not as good as the comparable's lot, that means the comparable is better so you subtract $5,000 from the comparable's price.  The net effect is to add $1,000 to the comparable.
Once the appraiser calculates the adjusted prices of all the comparables, the final step for developing a single estimate of market value is called:,Reconciliation.,Highest and best use.,Weighted substitution.,Gather data and investigage.,Reconciliation is the term used to describe the final step the appraiser takes to review all the results, determine how to weight the comparables, and make any final adjustments.
All of the following statements are true about the Cost Approach to valuation EXCEPT:,Depreciation is calculated for the buildings and land to reflect the three different types of depreciation (loss in value) to the subject property.,The cost to rebuild or replace the structure and other land improvements is calculated using today's construction costs.,The land is valued separately from the structure and site improvements.,The final result when adding the total cost to replace the subject property (land plus improvements) minus the approximate depreciation is a fair estimate of market value for the subject property.,The cost approach to valuation is another method for estimating the market value of the subject property.  It approximates the value a potential buyer might experience if he/she was to build a structure similar to the subject property on a vacant parcel.  The cost approach to appraisal uses these steps:  1- The value of the site (land without any man-made structures) is calculated, usually through the sales comparison approach.  2- The value of all the man-made improvements which have been applied to the land is calculated by looking at how much it will cost to replace or rebuild those improvements based on today's building codes, materials and prices.  3- The amount of the depreciation on the existing improvements is subtracted from the calculated value of the improvements calculated in item #2 above.  4- This figure is added to the value of the site.
The income capitalization approach for valuing real estate depends on each of the following elements EXCEPT:,Accurate depreciation information.,A property that generates a verifiable stream of operating income.,Operating income data for similar properties.,Recent sales data on similar properties.,The income capitalization approach to property valuation is useful when an appraiser can calculate the ratio of net operating income (NOI) to the sale prices of similar properties to derive a capitalization rate.  Then the appraiser applies that capitalization rate to the calculated NOI of the subject property to develop a likely sales price.
If the net operating income of a subject property is $1 million per year and the capitalization rate for similar income properties in that particular market is 10%, what is its estimated value using the income capitalization approach.,$10,000,000,$100,000,$1,000,000,Not enough information,The income capitalization approach uses the formula; Income/Capitalization=Value.  So, $1 million/10%=$10 million

When the Federal Reserve increases the supply of money, it:,Lowers interest rates and gives more purchasing power to people.,Helps lower prices and places a restraint on inflation.,Gives more purchasing power to people by raising the interest rates.,Almost always leads to higher demand for money, so the net effect is small.,During times of recession, the Federal Reserve would like to give more purchasing power to people, and so it increases the supply of money and works to lower interest rates.
The three tools used by the Federal Reserve to reduce the supply of money are:,Increase the reserve requirement, raise the discount rate, sell securities in the open market.,Sell securities in the open market, raise lending standards, raise the reserve requirement.,Increase enforcement of Regulation Z, raise the reserve requirement, buy securities in the open market.,Increase the reserve requirement, lower the 10-Year Treasury bond rate, raise the discount rate.,When the Federal Reserve wants to reduce the supply of money, it will sell securities in the open market, raise the discount rate and raise the reserve requirement.

Title is not a legal document, a piece of paper or anything tangible.  It can be defined as (1) A combination of all the elements that constitute a legal right to own, possess, use, control, enjoy and dispose of real estate.  (2) The rights of ownership recognized and protected by the law.
A lien on real property, documented by a signed mortgage contract gives the lender the right to:,Go to court and/or sell the property if the owner defaults any of the provisions of the mortgage,Collect a particular interest rate on the loan.,Sell the servicing rights to the loan to another investor.,Collect monthly payments for insurance and taxes and place them in an escrow account.,(Mortgage Law)  A mortgage lien provides security to the lender if the borrower does not honor all the terms of the mortgage contract, especially if the borrower fails to make the required payments.  In the event of borrower's default, the lien gives the lender certain rights, depending on the laws of each state.  In most cases, the lien allows the lender to sell the property to recoup some or all losses.
The key difference between a lien theory state and a title theory state is:,In a lien theory state, the property owner holds title but in a title theory state the lender or trustee holds title.,Only a lien theory state uses legal documents to convey property rights.,A title theory state will collect more transfer taxes because of the extra steps.,In a title theory state, the property owner always holds title.,(Mortgage Law)  A state that enforces "Lien Theory" allows the borrower to pledge the property purchased with the loan as collateral.  The borrower owns the property, and retains the title to it, but the lender holds a lien against it.  A state that enforces "Title Theory" allows the lender to retain the actual title to the property over the lifetime of the loan.  Once the buyer signs a mortgage, he or she typically signs a deed of trust, naming a third party to hold it for security.
Filing documents such as deeds, easements, and mortgages in the public record is known as:,Constructive notice or delivery.,Filing an opinion of title.,Right of disclosure.,Actual notice.,(Deeds)  Deeds, liens and other property claims are recorded in the public record so that the history and background of a property can be researched.  This is known as giving constructive notice.
The main purpose of title insurance is:,To compensate the policy holder for any losses incurred from an unidentified defect in the title.,To prove the seller has the right to sell the property.,To compensate the lender in the event of loss due to default on the loan.,To compensate the property owner if the seller does not have sufficient funds to clear all liens based on the discounted selling price.,Title insurance protects a policy holder from any events that occurred before the issuance of the policy.  This protects the policy holder against any losses that may arise from defects in the title.  If the insurance company deems the title insurable (based upon an examination of the public records), the company agrees to compensate the policy holder for any losses incurred due to unidentified defects in the title.
One of the more common methods for assessing property taxes is based on a percentage of the value of the property, also known as:,Ad Valorem taxes.,Market value taxes.,Assessed value taxes.,Proportionate contribution taxes.,(Property Tax & Title Insurance)  Taxes that are calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of a property are called ad valorem taxes, meaning according to value.

Which of the following statements is FALSE about conventional loans?,Lenders may not establish their own underwriting standards,The GSE's dominate this market category,Congress establishes the loan limits each year for 1-to-4-family structures,A non-conforming loan can be sold in the secondary market,(Loan Types & Leverage)  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together routinely purchase more than two out of three of all residential mortgages in the nation.  They are referred to as GSE's or government sponsored enterprises.  The GSE's set underwriting guidelines for conforming loans on one- to four-units properties.  The loan limits are set each year by Congress.  Any loan exceeding the published loan limit for a one- to four-unit property cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  These are called jumbo or non-conforming loans and are purchased by other secondary market investors.
Automated underwriting systems offer the following benefits EXCEPT:,Reduced closing cost to borrower,Objective-free of discrimination,Speed and low operating cost,Immediate feedback for correcting deficiencies,(Application & Underwriting)  The benefit of using an automated underwriting program is the speed in which an answer is delivered on the acceptability of a loan, and the GSE's willingness to purchase it once closed.

The purpose of APR is to more easily communicate to the borrower his/her true annual cost of that proposed mortgage loan.  The APR does NOT affect the monthly payment or the amount of interest paid - those amounts are calculated solely from the loan's STATED interest rate.  An APR can change after the initial TIL disclosure with an additional disclosure within 3 business days of discovering any change in APR exceeding 1/8%.
The loan to value (LTV) on a $525,000 purchase in which the borrower placed $100,000 cash down is:,80.9%,19%,Not enough information to determine,91.7%,(Loan Types & Leverage)  The LTV percentage is the loan value divided by the purchase price.  When we know the cash down payment and purchase price, we assume the difference is the loan amount.  So, the loan amount is $425,000 ($525,000 - $100,000 = $425,000)  Therefore, the LTV is $425,000/$525,000 = 80.9%
What is the amount of pre-paid interest to the borrower if her $205,000 loan at 5.5% annual interest rate closes on November 15?,$501.12,$939.58,$258.33,$370.00,205,000 X .055 = 11275 then divide that # by 12 to get the monthly interest   paid, which is 939.58. Since every month has 30 days with Loan problems  we divide that # by 30 and get $31.32 dollars per day interest. Closing is supposed to be Funding so we must assume that in our calculations. 16 days with counting the day of Closing would give us $501.12
A new Truth-in-Lending (TIL) disclosure must be provided:,Within 3 business days of discovering the annual percentage rate changed by more than 1/8%.,At least 3 days prior to closing whether there has been a change in annual percentage rate or not.,Within 3 business days of discovering the annual percentage rate changed by more than 1/4%,Within 7 business days of discovering the annual percentage rate changed by more than 1/4%.,(TILA)  A new TIL disclosure must be provided within 3 business days of discovering the annual percentage rate (APR) has changed by more than 1/8%.
