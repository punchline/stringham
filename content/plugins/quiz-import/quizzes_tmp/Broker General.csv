The R's bought a home and obtained a loan for $128,000 at 7.25% interest per year, 30 year term. Their monthly P/I payment is $873.19. What is the total amount of interest they will pay over the full term of the loan?,$186,348.40,$314,348.00,$196,500.38,$278,400.00,This one is so easy!  P/I pmt. Of $873.19 times 360 payments = total payoff.  Subtract the original loan and the rest is the interest.
A straight loan has monthly interest payments of $738.02. The interest rate is 7.67%. What is the amount of the principal?,$115,465.97,$118,934.89,$124,362.08,$130,698.98,All loan problems:  Loan is FIRST interest is RATE and interest payment is LAST.  Just remember, interest % is annual so you may have to adjust the interest dollars to be annual because R equals L.  So take the $738.02 monthly interest times 12 to annualize it.  Then "divide the one below the line by the one above the line" or $8,856.24 divided by 7.67% = the principal (original loan or current balance).
A residence had an appraised value of $338,245 and an assessed rate of 65%. The taxes were $3,720.70. What was the tax rate?,0.017,0,0.02,0.12,Remember the "full house" formula, straight down in a line A,A,A,T,T (aces and tens).  From the top:  Appraised Value, Assessed Rate, Assessed Value, Tax Rate, Taxes due.  Just fill in the numbers where they go and multiply down or divide up.  In this case, multiply down to the Assessed Value, then divide up by dividing the assessed value by the tax amount.
The buyers insisted they were not interested in a property that was less than 1.75 acres in size. A house on a property that was 465 feet by 643 feet looked great. How many acres does it have?,6.86,4.5,5.75,7.25,Length times width gives area:  465' x 643' = 298,995 sq. feet.  Divide by 43,560 (the number of feet in an acre).
Broker L listed a home that sold for the full price of $325,000. The contract called for a 6.5% commission. How much did Broker L make?,$21,125,$18,500,$20,250,$23,500,These are simple:  sales price multiplied by the commission percent for the commission dollars.  Or, commission dollars divided by the sales price for the commission %.
The loan on the property was for 85% of its appraised value. The interest on the loan was 9%. The interest in the first payment was $1,205 . What was the appraised value of the property?,$189,020,$195,383,$200,555,$215,769,Whoa, this one throws a lot at you!  Start at the end:  we want the appraised value, but the loan was only 85% of that.  So first we have to arrive at the loan.  Remember:  Loan is FIRST, the interest % is RATE, and the interest dollars are LAST (and must be annualized to match the rate).  So, $1,205 x 12 = $14,460 annualized interest.  Divide the one below the line by the one above (interest rate) and get $160,666.67 for the loan.  Now 2nd FRL, appraised value came FIRST, 85% is the RATE, and the loan is LAST.  "Divide the one below the line by the one above the line" or the loan by 85% to get the appraised value.
The owner wants to net $40,000 upon selling the property. The commission is 7%, there will be $2,500 in closing costs, plus a $450 fee to the attorney. What does the property need to sell for to get the owner $40,000 net?,$46,182.80,$50,125.00,$200,555,$215,716,Always have to go "bottom up" on this.  Work from the top down and you'll be close, but no cigar!  FIRST is the selling price, our "I don't know" so the question mark goes there.  LAST is the net.  But the seller doesn't only need the $40,000, but also enough to cover closing costs and the attorney.  So $42,950 is what he really needs to net.  For LAST, what % equals the "net?"  It sells for the magic 100%, 7% comes out for commission, so 93% equals the net.  Divide the one below the line by the one above, or $42,950 by 93% to get the answer.
The commission split is 70/30, and the brokerage charges sellers 6%. The agent took home $8,500 last month for one sale. What was the selling price?,$202,381,$195,682,$198,434,$201,999,This is a two FRL question because it deals with two percents.  We start with the agent's portion as that's what we're given.  LAST is the agent's $8,500.  FIRST is the gross commission, our "I don't know."  RATE is 70% (remember the agent's split is the first number).  Divide the one below the line by the one above, or $8,500 by 70% to get the gross commission.  Then, same idea for the 2nd FRL.  LAST is the gross commission which you just computed.  FIRST is the selling price which we don't know.  RATE equals what is in L, and the rate that equals the gross commission is 6%.  Again, divide this one below the line by the one above for the answer.
