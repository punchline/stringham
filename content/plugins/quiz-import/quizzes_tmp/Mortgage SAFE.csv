If the insurance company deems the title insurance, the company agrees to compensate the policyholder for any losses incurred due to identified defects in the title.
A lender is very interested in having the borrower obtain title insurance because:,When a lender's title policy is issued following an extensive title search it is reasonable assurance title is clear and any losses from claims on title will be reimbursed.,An owner's title policy provides more comprehensive coverage to the lender since it is for the full purchase price.,Once an owner's policy is issued the title is marketable.,With title insurance in place, defects on title leading to claims for compensation are rare.,Lenders require an extensive examination of public records and often, a current survey, before they issue a loan. Therefore, lenders consider a lender's title policy the ideal evidence and protection of title because insurance companies thoroughly examine public records before issuing a policy. A lender's title policy is issued for the amount of the loan.
